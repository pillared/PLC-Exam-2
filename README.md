# PLC-Exam-2
* Exam 2 has 4 coding questions
* Q1: Takes a textfile q1.txt and processes that file for the following lexemes:
    * Lexemes:
      * Perl style identifiers 
      *	Java-Style string literals
      *	C-Style integer literals
      *	C-Style character literals
      * C-Style floating point literals
      * Non-Alphanumerics (
            * Addition
            * Assignment
            * Subtraction
            * Division
            * Multiplication
            * Increment
            * Decrement
            * Modulo Operator
            * Logical And
            * Logical Or
            * Logical Not
            * Open Code Block
            * Close Code Block
            * Open Function parameter 
            * Close Function parameter )
* To run, just open terminal, cd to directory, and run the following command: python3 driver.py
  * Includes a py file for each lexeme, and a driver file as well as a text file with a large amount of each lexemes and produces output. I started a script and ran the driver to log the output in a file.

* Q2: declares an array statically, one that declares the same large array on the stack, and one on the heap. Checks time for each.
  * To run, you must compile with gcc. For example, cd to directory, gcc -o array array.c. Once compiled, run ./array and view the time in seconds it takes for declarations of each type of array.
* Q6: A recursive decent algorithm for a java while statement, if statement , an logical/mathematical expression, and an assignment statement , where statement may be an empty function. Includes EBNF rule for each.

* Q8: A Perl program that implements static and dynamic scoping.

* PDF: Includes the following:
  * Table of Contents
  * Q1-Q8, code and explanations
  * References
